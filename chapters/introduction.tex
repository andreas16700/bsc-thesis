\section{Background}
The advent of serverless computing has opened new avenues for language performance and development convenience. This thesis explores Swift, a language traditionally known for iOS development, as a potential candidate for serverless computing, specifically in the OpenWhisk environment.
\section{Research Questions}
% You can list each research question in its own subsection
\subsection{Performance Comparison}
How does the performance of Swift compare to other serverless languages, such as Python, Java, and Node.js? We can run synthetic benchmarking workloads on OpenWhisk to compare the performance of Swift with other languages.
\subsection{Ease of Development}
How easy is it to develop serverless functions in Swift compared to other languages? We can evaluate the development experience of Swift by comparing it with other serverless languages.

In order to delve deeper into these research questions, a case study was conducted comparing a monolithic to a serverless implementation of a custom synchronization system, both in Swift. The latencies, throughput, and execution time of both systems were compared, providing a practical exploration of Swift's performance and development experience in a serverless context. This thesis aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the viability of Swift as a serverless language on OpenWhisk.
